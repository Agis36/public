**Last Updated:** December 08, 2025

## 1. Introduction
**MathQuest AI** ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting the privacy of children and parents. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data in our mobile application designed for children ages 4-13.

**Summary:**
*   We do **NOT** collect personal information.
*   We do **NOT** use third-party analytics or trackers.
*   We do **NOT** show advertisements.
*   All game progress and profiles are stored **locally on your device**.

## 2. Information Collection and Use

### A. Personal Information
We do not knowingly collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) from children or parents. We do not require account creation, email addresses, or phone numbers to use the app.

### B. Local Data Storage
The following data is stored locally on your device using `localStorage`:
*   Child profile names (nicknames) and avatars.
*   Game settings (sound, language, voice speed).
*   Game progress (scores, stars, streaks).
*   Parental PIN code.

If you delete the app or clear the app data, this information is permanently lost because we do not sync it to a cloud server.

### C. Microphone Usage & Voice Data
MathQuest AI allows children to answer questions using their voice.
*   **Usage:** The microphone is accessed only when the "Microphone" button is active during gameplay.
*   **Processing:** Voice data is processed in real-time by your device's operating system (Android Speech Services or Apple Speech Recognition).
*   **Storage:** We do **not** record, save, or upload audio recordings to our servers.

### D. AI Question Generation (Google Gemini API)
MathQuest AI uses Google's Gemini AI to generate unique math questions.
*   **What is sent:** When a game starts, we send an anonymous prompt (e.g., "Generate 5 math questions about Space for Age 7") to the API.
*   **What is NOT sent:** We do not send child names, voice data, location, or any personal identifiers to the AI service.

## 3. Children’s Privacy (COPPA & GDPR)
Our app is designed to comply with the **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)** and the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**.

*   We do not collect personal data from children under 13.
*   We do not use behavioral advertising.
*   We do not allow children to share personal information publicly.
*   The "Settings" menu is protected by a Parental PIN gate to prevent children from modifying app configurations or deleting data accidentally.

## 4. Third-Party Services
This app does not use third-party analytics SDKs (like Firebase Analytics or Facebook SDK) to track user behavior.

---

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

## 6. Service Availability & AI Disclaimer
MathQuest AI utilizes third-party AI services (Google Gemini API) to generate content.
*   **Service Continuity:** While we aim to provide uninterrupted service, we cannot guarantee the perpetual availability of the third-party AI service.
*   **Future Updates:** In the event of significant changes to third-party pricing or availability, we intend to update the application to support offline functionality where technically feasible, but this is not a binding guarantee of perpetual service.
*   **Accuracy:** Content is generated by AI. While we implement filtering, we cannot guarantee 100% accuracy of generated questions.
